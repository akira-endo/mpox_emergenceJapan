# mpox_emergenceJapan
Underlying code for Endo et al. "Mpox emergence in Japan: risks of establishment in Asia and the global resurgence" [https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-2548920/v1](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-2548920/v1)

## Note
The travel volume data (data/flight/flight_matrix_temp.csv) is replaced with a dummy file due to data restriction. Re-running script/Code_for_visualization.ipynb therefore does not accurately reproduce the original figure (Fig 1B).
